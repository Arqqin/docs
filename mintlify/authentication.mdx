description: "The Arqqin Parking Management API uses API key authentication for secure access to endpoints. All requests must include a valid API key in the request header."

## API Key Authentication

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header with every request:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://apistg.arqq.in/api/locations" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://apistg.arqq.in/api/locations', {
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://apistg.arqq.in/api/locations', headers=headers)
```
</CodeGroup>

## API Key Security

<Warning>
**Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.** API keys provide full access to your whitelist data and should be treated as sensitive credentials.
</Warning>

### Security Best Practices

<Accordion title="Secure Storage">
Store your API key securely:
- Use environment variables in production
- Never commit keys to version control
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Request Security">
Secure your API requests:
- Always use HTTPS endpoints
- Validate responses before processing
- Implement proper error handling
- Use rate limiting in your applications
</Accordion>

## API Key Scope

API keys are scoped to specific locations for enhanced security:

- **Location-Specific Access**: Each API key can only access designated locations
- **Permission-Based**: Keys are configured with appropriate permissions for your use case
- **Audit Trail**: All API usage is logged and auditable

<Info>
If you need access to additional locations, contact hello@arqqin.com to update your API key permissions.

## Error Responses

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
  }
}
```

### Missing API Key

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED", 
    "message": "API key is required"
  }
}
```

### Insufficient Permissions

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "API key doesn't have access to requested resource"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API keys are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Limit**: 1000 requests per hour per API key
- **Headers**: Rate limit information is included in response headers
- **Exceeded**: Requests exceeding the limit return a 429 status code

<CodeGroup>
```bash Response Headers
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

```json Rate Limit Exceeded
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Too many requests"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Testing Authentication

You can test your API key authentication using the health check endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://apistg.arqq.in/api/health" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://apistg.arqq.in/api/health', {
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data); // Should return health status
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'}
response = requests.get('https://apistg.arqq.in/api/health', headers=headers)
print(response.json())  # Should return health status
```
</CodeGroup>
