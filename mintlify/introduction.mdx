# Arqqin Parking Management API

The Arqqin Parking Management API provides a comprehensive solution for managing parking access through vehicle whitelists. Built with a reference-based architecture, it allows partners to manage parking access by adding, updating, and removing vehicles in a whitelist per location.

<Note>
This API is designed for integration with property management systems, residential complexes, and commercial parking facilities.

## System Architecture

The API follows a clean, reference-based architecture:

- **API Keys**: Scoped to specific locations for security
- **Vehicle Whitelists**: Managed per location with flexible filtering
- **Reference IDs**: Generic identifiers to group vehicles under any external entity (no PII required)

<Accordion title="Why Reference-Based Architecture?">
The reference-based approach provides flexibility and privacy:

- **No PII Required**: Reference IDs can represent any external entity without exposing personal information
- **Flexible Grouping**: Group multiple vehicles under residents, contracts, units, or fleet accounts
- **Privacy Compliant**: Maintains data privacy while enabling powerful vehicle management
- **Integration Friendly**: Easy to map to existing property management or CRM systems
